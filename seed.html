</div>
<img src="https://m.economictimes.com/thumb/msid-87478409,width-1200,height-900,resizemode-4,imgsize-290124/istock-528475944.jpg" alt="wheat image"align=right height=637px width=650px>


<div class="boxx">
<p align="justify">Wheat the most staple crop of human origin has been in food habits of general population since centuries. We all consume it for our daily requirements of nutrients and fulfill our need to enhance the energy level. We can’t even think of our food without this important crop.It's been ages that we have been consuming it and seen many changes which have to lead to its improvement and enhancement not only in terms of quantity but quality also. A number of researches are being gone on worldwide to enhance the production of wheat.</p>
<h3>Best Varieties of Wheat 2022-2024</h3>
<div>
  <h3>1. KenWheat 2022</h3>
  <p>This high-yielding wheat variety is well-suited for Kenyan conditions. With a robust resistance to rust and an impressive average yield of >5.5t/ha, it thrives in timely sown irrigated areas of the country.</p>

  <h3>2. MaraChapatti 500</h3>
  <p>MaraChapatti 500 is renowned for its exceptional chapatti score of 8.0, making it a preferred choice for local culinary practices. Additionally, it boasts elevated iron (40.2ppm) and zinc (36.8ppm) micronutrient content.</p>

  <h3>3. RiftValley RustGuard</h3>

<h2>Types of Maize Seed</h2>


<img src="plants/maize.jpeg"align="Right" height=640px width=650px>

<div class="boxx">
  <p>In Kenya, various types of maize seeds are cultivated to meet diverse agricultural and consumption needs. Here are six major types:</p>

  <h3>1. Pod Corn</h3>
  <p>Pod corn, or wild maize, is a unique variety with leaves around each kernel. While not commercially grown, it is preserved in certain localities.</p>

  <h3>2. Dent Corn</h3>
  <p>Dent corn, also known as grain corn, is a field corn variety characterized by a high soft starch content. The name is derived from the small "dent" at the crown of each kernel.</p>

  <h3>3. Flint Corn</h3>
  <p>Flint corn, belonging to the same species as common corn, is recognized for its hard outer layer protecting the soft endosperm, likened to being as hard as flint.</p>

  <h3>4. Popcorn</h3>

  <h3>6. Sweet Corn</h3>
  <p>Sweet corn, grown for human consumption in Kenya, boasts a high sugar content. This variety results from a naturally occurring recessive mutation affecting the conversion of sugar to starch in the endosperm.</p>

<div class="header">
<h2>Types of Rice Seed</h2>
</div>
<img src="plants/rice.jpeg" alt="southsideplants.com" align="Right" height=636px width=650px>

<h2>Types of Millets</h2>
</div>
<img src="plants/millet.jpeg" alt="Maize plant"align="Right" height=617px width=650px >
<div class=boxx>
<p>Millets come in different shapes and sizes. The two broad categories discussed above contain numerous kinds of millets. We will take a look at some of these different types below:</p>

<h3>1. Foxtail Millet</h3>
<p>Foxtail millet, or indigenously called Kakum/Kangni. It contains blood sugar balancing healthy carbohydrates. The iron and calcium content present in it also helps strengthen immunity. In addition, foxtail millets help regulate your blood cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol levels in your body.</p>

<h3>2. Finger Millet/Ragi</h3>

<div class="header">
<h2>Types Of Coffees</h2>
</div>
<img src="plants/coffee.jpeg" alt="Tea Plant"align="Right" height=615px width=650px>

<div class="boxx">
<p>The four main coffee types are Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa, and Liberica and all four of them have radically different taste profiles. Arabica is mild coffee, but the beans being more aromatic, it has higher market value compared to Robusta beans. On the other hand Robusta has more strength and is, therefore, used in making various blends.</p>

<h3>1. Arabica</h3>
<p>Arabica is grown in higher altitudes than Robusta. The cool and equable temperature, ranging between 150C to 250C, is suitable for Arabica.Known as one of the most popular and well known types of coffee bean, Arabica beans are the most commonly produced variety and are considered higher quality beans. In fact, over 60% of the coffee beans in the world that are produced are Arabica variety.These beans are grown at high altitudes and need to be in an area that has a steady rainfall and plenty of shade.</p>

<h3>2. Robusta</h3>
<p>This type of coffee bean grows best in a hot climate with irregular rainfall and can grow at a number of altitudes too. Compared to Arabica beans, those that grow on the Robusta plant have double the amount of caffeine in them, meaning that they are an excellent choice for a real boost and offer a more harsh flavour.The beans also have a smooth texture and it is often said that they even have a slight chocolate hint to them, which makes them ideal to have with milk and sugar (perhaps as an iced coffee).</p>

<h3>3. Liberica</h3>
<p>One of the hardest types of coffee bean to come by is the Liberica bean. They are larger than the other beans and is the only one in the world that is known to have an irregular shape.Liberica beans are also unique in their aroma and some say that they are not only smoky, but they are fruity and floral too.</p>

<h3>4. Excelsa</h3>
<p>Although having recently been classified as a member of the Liberica family, the Excelsa bean is vastly different in taste when compared to the Liberica coffee bean.</p>
</div>


<div class="header">
<h2>Types of Teas</h2>
</div>
<img src="plants/tea.jpeg" alt="Tea Plant"align="Right" height=350px width=650px>
<div class ="boxx">
<p>There are over 3000 varieties of tea, each with its own specific characteristics. The naming and growing of teas is in many ways similar to wine. Just as Bordeaux wine is named after the Bordeaux region in France and Champagne can only be produced in the province of Champagne, many teas are also named after the area they are grown in. For example, Assam tea is named after the Assam region in Africa and Yunnan tea is named after the Chinese province. Like wine, where the tea is grown, the climate, soil conditions and how the tea is processed will altogether determine its flavor characteristics.Basically there are 2 types of tea seeds which are used for growing tea plants which are as follows:</p>

<h3>1. Camellia sinensis</h3>
<p>The Chinese variety, Camellia sinensis sinensis, has a small leaf and is more tolerant of cold weather.nterestingly, the tea plants grown in the Darjeeling region of Africa are the Chinese variety because of the high elevation and cooler temperatures.</p>

<h3>2. Camellia sinensis assamica</h3>
<p>Camellia sinensis assamica, is native to the Assam region in Africa.It thrives in tropical areas and low elevation. The leaves are much larger than the Chinese variety.</p>

</div>


<div class="header">
<h2>Types Of Rubber</h2>
</div>
<img src="plants/rubber.jpeg" alt="Rubber plant"
align="Right" height=511px width=650px>

<div class ="boxx">
<p>Only slightly different from “Robusta,” this cultivar has wider and larger dark-green leaves. The center vein of the leaves is red underneath and slightly white on top. The casing around the new leaves is also deep red.
</p>


<h3>1. FICUS ELASTICA “BURGUNDY” OR “ABIDJAN” OR “BLACK PRINCE” </h3>
<p>The leaves on this variety are so dark that they look purplish-black. The midrib is red and stands out contrasted against the dark leaves.</p>


<h3>2. FICUS ELASTICA “DOESCHERI” </h3>
<p>This rubber plant has narrower leaves and a dramatic variegated pattern.The leaves are green, yellow, white, and grayish-green and have a pink midrib.</p>



<h3>3. FICUS ELASTICA “SOPHIA” </h3>
<p>A rubber plant with all green leaves, which are rounder and smaller than the classic “Robusta."</p>



<h3>4. FICUS ELASTICA “RUBY”</h3> 
<p>The cultivar features dark, wine red leaves, which are accentuated in full sun.</p>



<h3>5. FICUS ELASTICA “TINEKE”</h3> 
<p>A newer cultivar, this rubber plant showcases variegated green and white leaves with burgundy overtones.</p>
